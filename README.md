## Stand With Tibet [![StandWithTibet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodingWithTashi/StandWithTibet/refs/heads/main/assets/tibet.svg)](https://github.com/kimoandroid/StandWithPalestine/blob/main/Donate.md)
#### The ongoing situation in Tibet is deeply tragic and unbearable. The cries for justice are met with silence. The occupying forces continue their relentless oppression, leaving the Tibetan people in constant pain and suffering as they struggle for their right to exist.
#### When China invaded Tibet, the world turned a blind eye. The cries of the Tibetan people for freedom and justice were met with silence, while their suffering continued. Despite the brutal oppression and the struggle of a people longing for their basic rights, the international community remained indifferent, leaving Tibet to endure the pain of occupation alone.
